```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

just because you can do it doesnt mean you want to with visualization(color shape size etc)
## Facets
subplots that display subsets
- everything on the same scale so you can make comparison still
many ways to do it
2 things
- assign the ggplot to a letter
  q <- [code]   this makes it so when you want to modify you don't have to type it all again
  
```{r}
q <- ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
```{r}
q + facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```

```{r}
q + facet_grid(drv ~ .)
```

```{r}
q + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

```{r}
q + facet_wrap(~ class)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + geom_bar(aes(x = class, fill = class))
```

```{r}
